This repository demonstrates an unexpected route matching issue in React Router v6 when using exact path matching alongside a wildcard route.  The problem arises when a specific route is defined before a wildcard route, causing the wildcard route to be ignored even when no other routes match. The solution involves carefully ordering routes to ensure that the wildcard route is matched only when no other path matches.
